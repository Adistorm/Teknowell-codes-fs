For Season 13, registrations opened in August 2025, with a deadline of September 18, 2025. You must register on the official TCS CodeVita portal to participate. 
The competition consists of three rounds:
Pre-Qualifier Round: An online, 6-hour coding challenge that participants can take at any time within a 24-hour window. Solving at least one question well can lead to an interview opportunity with TCS for a Ninja profile.
Qualifier Round: Shortlisted students from Round 1 face a more difficult 6-hour online challenge. Performing well here can lead to a Digital profile job offer.
